/**
 * Client-side Reverse Connect support.
 *
 * <p>The package owns the client-side listener and manager responsibilities that happen before
 * normal client UA-TCP handshaking begins. A {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectManager} binds one or more client
 * listener sockets, accepts server-opened TCP channels, requires the first message to be {@code
 * ReverseHello}, applies pre-SecureChannel admission policy, and either claims the channel for a
 * matching selector or holds it briefly as a pending candidate.
 *
 * <h2>Client workflows</h2>
 *
 * <p>Applications that know their expected servers ahead of time can create clients with a shared
 * manager and a {@link org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectSelector}. The
 * client transport registers the selector during connect, waits for one matching candidate, and
 * rejoins the normal client Session path after the channel is claimed.
 *
 * <h2>Candidate lifecycle</h2>
 *
 * <p>Every accepted server-opened socket starts in {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#WAITING_FOR_REVERSE_HELLO}.
 * If the first message is a valid {@code ReverseHello} and the configured {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseHelloVerifier} accepts the candidate, the
 * candidate becomes {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#PENDING}. From pending,
 * exactly one terminal manager outcome is recorded: {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#CLAIMED}, {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#REJECTED}, {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#EXPIRED}, or {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectCandidateState#CLOSED}.
 *
 * <p>Selector matching is one-shot. A registered selector is evaluated against already-pending
 * candidates and later candidates after their {@code ReverseHello} has been verified. The first
 * selector that matches claims the channel and transfers ownership to the returned {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectConnection}; after that handoff, manager
 * shutdown will not close the claimed child channel. Candidates that do not match remain pending
 * for the configured hold time. Rejection snapshots preserve whether the candidate failed because
 * the first message timed out, the {@code ReverseHello} was malformed, a verifier rejected it, an
 * application rejected it, the pending limit was exceeded, the hold time expired, the manager
 * stopped, the peer closed the channel, or a selector threw.
 *
 * <p>Listener callbacks are serialized on the manager callback executor. For a successfully claimed
 * candidate the callback order is accepted, then claimed if a selector was already waiting, or
 * accepted, pending, then claimed when the candidate first has to be parked. Rejected, expired, and
 * closed candidates are reported with the terminal snapshot. Manager snapshots expose current
 * pending candidates plus bounded retained histories of claimed and rejected terminal snapshots;
 * snapshots are immutable and can be safely retained by application code.
 *
 * <p>Dynamic applications can observe pending candidates, claim one exact candidate with {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectManager#claim(java.util.UUID)}, resolve
 * application-specific client configuration, and create an {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.OpcUaClient} from the resulting {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectConnection}. A direct claimed connection
 * is one-shot: after it is consumed, reconnect requires a new reverse-connect candidate.
 *
 * <p>When a dynamic application does not have a usable {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.stack.core.types.structured.EndpointDescription} before the first inbound
 * socket arrives, {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.DiscoveryFirstReverseConnectClient} provides the
 * one-shot path: wait for one discovery candidate, run GetEndpoints over that consumed connection,
 * select an endpoint with {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectEndpointSelector}, create a normal
 * reverse client, and wait for a later matching reverse connection for the production Session.
 * Shared-listener applications that want to accept multiple unknown servers can use {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectAcceptor} to repeat the same
 * discovery-first flow per deduplicated candidate key. The default discovery-first endpoint policy
 * selects no-security endpoints that allow anonymous Session activation; callers that configure
 * certificates or another identity provider should supply a matching endpoint selector and client
 * config factory. A discovery result with no endpoints is treated as a configuration failure before
 * endpoint selection runs, so applications can distinguish an empty server response from an
 * endpoint selector that inspected the response but chose no endpoint.
 *
 * <p>The lower-level discovery primitive is {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectDiscovery}. It registers a selector with
 * the manager, consumes the first matching {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectConnection} with {@link
 * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.DiscoveryClient#getEndpoints(org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectConnection)},
 * and returns a {@link org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseConnectDiscoveryResult}
 * containing the claim-time routing snapshot and discovered endpoints. The discovery connection is
 * not reused for the production Session.
 *
 * <h2>Transport handoff</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@link org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.client.reverse.ReverseTcpClientTransport} is the bridge back
 * to the normal client SDK path. It waits for the manager to hand off a claimed channel, or
 * consumes one pre-claimed connection directly, installs the standard client UASC pipeline, and
 * then lets the Session FSM create and maintain the Session as it would for outbound TCP.
 *
 * <h2>Security boundary</h2>
 *
 * <p>{@code ReverseHello} is only a routing and resource-admission hint. The types here
 * deliberately keep server identity validation in the normal Milo client certificate, endpoint,
 * security policy, SecureChannel, and Session validation flow after a claimed channel rejoins the
 * client transport pipeline.
