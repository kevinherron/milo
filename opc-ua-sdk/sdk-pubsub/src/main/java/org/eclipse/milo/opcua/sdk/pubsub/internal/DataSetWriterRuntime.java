/**
 * Runtime for one DataSetWriter: pulls its source for a snapshot and produces at most one
 * DataSetMessage draft per publish cycle.
 *
 * <p>Source failures never cause a missed cycle: the draft is produced with every field set to
 * {@code Bad_InternalError} and the failure is recorded in diagnostics. (A source failure flips
 * every field's status, so the failing cycle and the recovery cycle each emit a key frame via the
 * all-fields-changed rule below.)
 *
 * <p>Key frame cadence (Part 14 §6.2.4.3): {@code keyFrameCount} is "the multiplier of the
 * PublishingInterval that defines the maximum number of times the PublishingInterval expires before
 * a key frame message with values for all published Variables is sent". A per-writer cycle counter
 * advances on every publishing-interval tick — including ticks that were suppressed or covered by a
 * keep-alive — and a key frame is emitted on the first cycle after writer start/group (re)activate
 * and whenever the counter reaches {@code keyFrameCount}; the cycles in between emit delta frames
 * of the changed fields. A {@code keyFrameCount} of 0 (the spec's non-cyclic/event value, which
 * Milo does not model) is clamped to 1 at runtime, so 0 and 1 both mean every message is a key
 * frame; configs round-trip unmodified.
 *
 * <p>Change detection (§5.3.3: a delta frame "only contains the subset that changed since the
 * previous DataSetMessage") diffs against the last-transmitted per-field values, comparing the
 * mask-projected wire representation of each field — the {@link DataSetFieldContentMask}-filtered
 * DataValue members, or the Table 34 Variant projection — rather than raw {@code DataValue.equals},
 * so e.g. a timestamp-only change counts only when timestamps are actually transmitted. A change of
 * the raw field StatusCode always counts, even when the status is not on the wire for the
 * configured masks.
 *
 * <p>If no fields changed on a delta cycle, nothing is sent (§6.2.4.3: "If no changes exist, the
 * delta frame DataSetMessage shall not be sent"): no sequence number is consumed and {@code
 * lastSentNanos} does not advance, so the group's keep-alive emission (§6.2.6.3) takes over. If
 * every field changed, a key frame is emitted instead and the cadence counter resets — a
 * full-coverage delta is strictly larger than the key frame under both mappings (§7.2.4.5.6: "The
 * Publisher shall send a key frame message if the delta frame message is larger than a key frame
 * message"). Partial deltas are not byte-compared against the key frame (that would require
 * double-encoding every cycle), so a delta of n-1 tiny changed fields may occasionally exceed the
 * key frame size; this residue is accepted.
 *
 * <p>If the configuration cannot express (or cannot safely carry) a delta frame — a JSON writer
 * without the DataSetMessageHeader or the MessageType member (Annex A.3.3.4/A.3.4.4), or a UADP
 * writer with a non-zero ConfiguredSize (the fixed-size layout is key-frame-only per Annex A.2.1.7,
 * and a DataSetMessage exceeding its ConfiguredSize is re-encoded header-only with the valid bit
 * clear per §6.3.1.3.3 yet still SENDS, so a delta lost that way would bypass the not-transmitted
 * baseline invalidation below and leave subscribers silently stale) — the writer degrades safely to
 * emitting a key frame every cycle, e.g. when such a writer is enabled after startup validation
 * ran. A ConfiguredSize key frame that overflows its fixed size is valid-cleared on the wire but
 * self-heals: the next cycle emits a full key frame again (the pre-delta posture). These
 * expressibility rules belong to the built-in mappings and are not applied when a custom provider
 * is resolved for the group's mapping name (see {@link #resolveDeltaCapable}).
 *
 * <p>The baseline tracks the last TRANSMITTED values (§5.3.3), not merely the last drafted ones:
 * when {@code WriterGroupRuntime#publishPartition} fails to put a NetworkMessage on the wire
 * (encode failure, oversize skip, send failure), it calls {@link #invalidateDeltaBaseline()} for
 * the writers whose data DataSetMessages the message carried, and the next data draft is a key
 * frame — otherwise the next delta would diff against values the subscriber never received and a
 * field changed only in the dropped cycle would stay silently stale until the next cadence key
 * frame. The dropped message's consumed sequence number is not rolled back: the resulting gap is
 * wire-indistinguishable from network loss, which subscribers must already tolerate (§7.2.3). Two
 * bounded residues remain: an asynchronous send-failure callback may land only after the next cycle
 * drafted (and possibly transmitted) one more delta against the untransmitted baseline, healed by
 * the key frame one cycle later; and a key frame that itself exceeds the group's
 * maxNetworkMessageSize is dropped and re-forced every cycle, so such a misconfigured writer
 * transmits no data (an honest failure with per-cycle diagnostics) instead of emitting deltas
 * against a baseline that can never be transmitted — though it still emits keep-alives when the
 * group has a keepAliveTime, because {@code lastSentNanos} only advances when a message is actually
 * handed to the transport channel (see {@link #lastSentNanos()} and {@code
 * WriterGroupRuntime#publishPartition}).
 *
 * <p>The DataSetMessage sequence counter (§7.2.3) wraps at the wire DataType maximum of the group's
 * mapping — 2^16 for UADP's UInt16, 2^32 for JSON's UInt32 and for custom mappings (see {@link
 * DataSetMessageSequenceCounter}). The counter is instance state, so writer recreation —
 * reconfigure, and the metadata/ConfigurationVersion changes that imply it — restarts the
 * DataSetMessage sequence at 0; subscribers recover from the apparent backward jump by whichever
 * comes first: the recreated writer's first keep-alive, whose carried next-expected value reseeds
 * the subscriber's window in both timeout modes (§7.2.4.5.8 — the publisher is authoritative about
 * its own counter; requires the group to emit keep-alives), the §7.2.3 two-times-receive-timeout
 * record discard when a messageReceiveTimeout is configured, or the 16-consecutive-rejection
 * restart heuristic of {@link ReaderSequenceTracker} when it is not.
 *
 * <p>Draft creation, the DataSetMessage sequence counter, the cadence counter, and the delta
 * baseline are confined to the owning group's publish task thread; the two cross-thread inputs are
 * the baseline-invalidated flag (written from transport callbacks) and the frame-state reset
 * generation (written from {@link WriterGroupRuntime#activate()} on the engine thread), both
 * volatile and both consumed at the start of each data draft. The reset in particular must NOT be
 * applied on the engine thread: a stale publish cycle that passed its activation-generation check
 * before the (re)activation may still be drafting, and would otherwise observe half-reset state and
 * emit a delta against the wrong baseline.

   * org.eclipse.milo.opcua.sdk.pubsub.uadp.MessageMappingProvider} — including one registered under

   * field over the key frame, so a busy partial delta can exceed a key-frame-sized budget) would
   * leave every subscriber silently stale against a baseline they never received. Every-cycle key
   * frames restore the self-healing posture: a valid-cleared key frame is simply superseded by the
   * next cycle's key frame. The message-type bits themselves are always expressible — DataSetFlags2
   * is part of the unconditional UADP DataSetMessage header (Table 158 defines no mask bit that
