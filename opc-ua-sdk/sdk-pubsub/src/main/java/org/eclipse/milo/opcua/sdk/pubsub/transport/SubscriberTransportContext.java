 * @param connection the config of the connection the channel is opened for.
 * @param eventLoopGroup the Netty {@link EventLoopGroup} the channel must use for I/O.
 * @param messageConsumer the consumer every received message is delivered to. The buffer is only
 *     valid for the duration of the callback; the consumer must {@code retain()} it to keep it
 *     longer, and the channel releases it after the callback returns.
 * @param topicMessageConsumer the topic-aware consumer for transports that know the source queue
 *     (topic) of a received message, or {@code null} when the engine did not supply one. A broker
 *     transport channel should deliver via this consumer when it is present, passing the source
 *     topic, and via {@code messageConsumer} otherwise; transports without topics (e.g. UDP) always
 *     use {@code messageConsumer}. A message is delivered to exactly one of the two consumers. The
 *     buffer validity rules of {@code messageConsumer} apply unchanged.
 * @param transportStateListener an optional engine callback the provider may invoke to report
 *     connectivity changes (see {@link TransportStateListener}), or {@code null} when the engine
 *     supplied none. A provider that does not track connectivity ignores it.
 * @apiNote Create instances via one of the {@code of(...)} factory methods rather than the
 *     canonical constructor; the factory methods are stable while the canonical constructor is not.
