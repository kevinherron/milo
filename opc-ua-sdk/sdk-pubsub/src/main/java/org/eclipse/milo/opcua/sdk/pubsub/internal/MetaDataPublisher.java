/**
 * DataSetMetaData publication for one broker connection (OPC UA Part 14 §6.4.2.5.5/.6, §5.2.3),
 * owned by the connection's {@link ConnectionRuntime}; UDP connections have none (UADP discovery
 * handles metadata there).
 *
 * <p>Per writer, retained metadata is published to the writer's metadata queue — the configured
 * {@code metaDataQueueName} (writer level over group level) or the Part 14 §7.3.4.7.4 derived topic
 * — encoded by the group's message mapping via {@link
 * MessageMappingProvider#encodeMetaData(MetaDataEncodeContext, DataSetMetaDataType, UShort)}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>once when the writer activates (startup, enable, reconfigure restart) — initiated before
 *       the writer can contribute data DataSetMessages, satisfying the §5.2.3 metadata-before-data
 *       ordering best-effort;
 *   <li>once when a reconfiguration changes the metadata of a live writer's dataset without
 *       restarting the writer (safety net; dataset changes normally restart referencing writers);
 *   <li>periodically when the effective {@code MetaDataUpdateTime} is positive (writer-level
 *       settings over group-level, which is Milo-local); zero means on-change only, relying on the
 *       retain flag for infinite retention.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The {@link #lastPublished} on-change baseline records only <i>confirmed</i> sends: a failed
 * send leaves the baseline untouched and is retried with bounded backoff until the first success,
 * covering the common case of the activation publish racing the transport's asynchronous broker
 * connect (broker channels fail fast until connected). After the bounded retries are exhausted the
 * periodic task and the reconfigure on-change check remain as retry opportunities; a broker
 * reconnect additionally republishes retained metadata because the transport reports it (Part 14
 * R16 {@code TransportStateListener}), which recovers the connection to {@code Operational} and
 * re-activates its writers — and {@link #onWriterActivated} publishes on every activation.
 *
 * <p>Sequence numbers come from the service's per-PublisherId announcement counter (Part 14
 * §7.2.4.6.3 Table 168 scope); a stream of one writer's metadata messages is strictly increasing
 * but may have gaps where other writers consumed values.
 *
 * <p><b>Threading:</b> activation/deactivation hooks run under the engine lock; periodic tasks run
 * on the service scheduled executor and the reconfigure check on the connection's dispatch queue,
 * both without the engine lock. Mutable state is guarded by this publisher's own lock; the engine
 * lock is never acquired from inside it. Sends are initiated inline while holding these locks,
 * which is safe only because {@link PublisherChannel#send(io.netty.buffer.ByteBuf, MessageAddress)}
 * pins a non-blocking contract on implementations. Publication failures are recorded in
 * diagnostics, never thrown: metadata publication is auxiliary and must not fail the writer.
